# EmailSpamChecker

This project was to create a Bayesian network to create a probability of spam or ham emails based on training data. Running the training file will read all of the training text files of emails and compile a list and create a probability of specific words appearing and their likelihood of being ham or spam. Then with this probability made, after running the testing file it will test this network on a list of emails to estimate if the emails are spam or ham
